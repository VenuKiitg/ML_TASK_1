# CampusPulse

## Project Overview

CampusPulse is a data analysis project focused on identifying, understanding, and interpreting anonymized features within a given dataset. The project performs in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical profiling to uncover hidden patterns and derive insights.

## Objective

The main objective is to:
- Understand the nature and relationships of anonymous variables in a dataset.
- Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to interpret data structure and distribution.
- Draw meaningful inferences without prior knowledge of feature semantics.

##  Methodology

The analysis includes:
- Data loading and basic cleaning
- Descriptive statistics
- Univariate and bivariate visualizations
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Outlier detection
- Hypotheses generation based on distributions and relations

## Techniques Used

- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps
- **Statistical tools**: Correlation coefficients, distribution analysis
